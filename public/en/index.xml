      <description>Abstract&amp;mdash; The aim of this paper is to provde a summary analysis of the data regarding the effectiveness of gunrestriction policy in diminishing the numberof gun-related deaths. We do so by conducting an analysis of three different datasets, and by combining the data we gathered from them, constructing a linear regression model. The constructed linear regression model shows a negative correlation between the gun-related death rate and the amount of legislation present within the state.</description>

      <description>Why make a random website? Why make a random-ass website? There so many!&#xA;I simply don&amp;rsquo;t care. Why do people make social media accounts, if they&amp;rsquo;ve nothing to share? At least as I share my nothing into the void, I stand to learn something. Maybe some new components of hugo. Maybe, who knows, one day I&amp;rsquo;ll rewrite this all into go and htmx. I find intrinsic value in knowing that I likely stand to learn from whatever I&amp;rsquo;m doing at any given time.</description>

      <description>What is Beeper Beeper is a messaging app that seeks to end the issue of fragmentation, by allowing users to use any of 14 currently supported protocols for their chats. These protocols include things like Whatsapp, Telegram, Discord, Slack and many more.&#xA;Recently my turn has arrived to access to Beeper&amp;rsquo;s open beta. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to try it out for the past couple of days and I must say, I&amp;rsquo;m impressed.</description>

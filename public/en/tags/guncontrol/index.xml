      <description>Abstract&amp;mdash; The aim of this paper is to provde a summary analysis of the data regarding the effectiveness of gunrestriction policy in diminishing the numberof gun-related deaths. We do so by conducting an analysis of three different datasets, and by combining the data we gathered from them, and constructing a linear regression model. The constructed linear regression model shows a negative correlation between the gun-related death rate and the amount of legislation present within the state.</description>

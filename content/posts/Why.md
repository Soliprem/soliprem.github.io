# Why make a random website?
Why make a random-ass website? There so many!

I simply don't care. Why do people make social media accounts, if they've nothing to share? At least as I share my nothing into the void, I stand to learn something. Maybe some new components of hugo. Maybe, who knows, one day I'll rewrite this all into go and htmx. I find intrinsic value in knowing that I likely stand to learn from whatever I'm doing at any given time.

The real deal comes in the fact that this is just *my* space. It's not twitter, instagram, or whatever. It's me, and I have all of the freedom I could dream for to express myself within this website. I feel like social media has a chokehold on both free time and creative expression, and I seek to change it on a personal level by minimizing my engagement with it. So from now on, I'll try to keep it simple, and write things here. [this](/posts/index.xml) is an RSS feed you can subscribe to to know when I post new things.

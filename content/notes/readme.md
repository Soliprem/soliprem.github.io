# Swiki
This is my personal Wiki. Its purpose is to have my notes (taken in markdown), be accessible in a site format from anywhere I might be. 
Feel free to use in whatever way you see fit, but do not hold me accountable for any inaccurate information. I'm bound to get stuff wrong every now and then

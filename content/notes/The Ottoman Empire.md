# The Ottoman Empire
 The Ottomans began as a community of Turkish-speaking pastoralists; they might have benefited from the bubonic pandemic (mostly urban and agrarian)
 they gradually expanded in Anatolia and the Balkans
 By 1453, the Ottomans took over Constantinople
 Their success rested on:
 1. growing military power, though with limits
 2. liberl religious policy;
 3. healthy finances

# Ottoman Expansion
- Between 1514 and 1526, battlefield victories stabilized the Ottoman's eastern frontier with the Shi'a

## Ottoman Consolidation
- Ottoman integrted firearms by 1390s, artillery by 1420s
- Rebuilt Istanbul's fortifications in 1453
- Hired elite infantrymen, the janissaries
- Also invested heavily in a powerful navy

# Europe vs the Ottoman Empire
European primacy was limited to the seas until eighteenth century
- no huge land acquisitions but naval bases and coastal strongholds
- Paradox of overseas expansion and retreat on European eastern border under the pressure of the turkish forces
  - Vienna besieged in 1529
  - Vienna attacked again in 1683

## The Ottoman Taxes: The Millet System
- Mehmet the Conqueror centralized taxation and tried to raise txes on provincial elites
- Local elites were resistand; the state increasingly tuned to tax farming
- The Ottomans were very tolerant, accepting tens of thousands of Spanish Jews in 1492
- Non-Muslims were taxed higher, but were also left to conduct their own affairs (the so-called millet "system", teh millet beind an independent court of law)

In the past private law was "just the civil code"  
We had a shift in the interpretation of the constitution

### Who interprets the Law
[Court Levels](/notes/Court Levels)
[Constitution](/notes/Public Law)


The state (parlament) is the legislature: it makes the law (for the most part)  
The judges have the duty to apply the law  
Then there's the other lads: lawyers, achademics, who have to interpret the law, too  
THe *dominant* intepretation of the law arises from the whole pool of interpreters

## Civil Law vs Common Law
Common Law: GB, USA, Commonwealth  
Civil Law System: EU

Civil Law: Judges can't make new laws  
Common Law: Judges can create new rules, in the absence of precedent  

| Civil Law                                                           | Common Law                          |
| -                                                                   | -                                   |
| EU                                                                  | UK, USA, Commonwealth               |
| Judges can't make new rules                                         | Judges can make new rules (caselaw) |
| Omofilattia: judges follow the supreme court's decisions (probably) |                                     |
| [Sources of Law](/notes/Sources of Law Civil Law)                          |                                     |

BUT there're times when the interpretations of law create strong paths in Civil Law, too: the definitions get blurry  
(example  
Art. 2: A judge makes a ruling counting a "new" fundamental right. It's likely to be observed.)

## Rights
rights are protected (in Italy) by:
- [Constitution](/notes/Constitution)
- Civil Code


there's low of Human rights 


Foundamental rights are:
- Absolute: to anyone, from anyone
- not patrimonial: can't be transfered, no econ value
- not subjet to [prescription](/notes/prescription): no expity date, dont' fade if not used for a while.

### Disposition of on'e own body or parts of it (art5 C.C.)
Transfer of onw's own body or parts of it: FOrbidden when the physical integrity of an individual is permanently impaired, or when this is contrary to the law, public order or morality.  
when it's not permanent, you can:
- Collect small amounts of blood
- donate a kidney or part of a liver
- L.164/1982 (Rules concerning change of the original gender)

What are "commons"?

# Court Levels

- 3rd level: [Supreme Court](/notes/Supreme Court) (corte di Cassazione)
- 4th level: [Constitutional Court](/notes/Constitutional Court)

Before 1 and 2 you go into the "real facts", the situation. Before 3, you have to focus on the law, not just the facts of the concrete situation.

SC is not about the facts as much as it is about the "correct interpretation of the law": the ratio of this law is just about your act

SC has a "funzione Omofilattica"

# Slave Trade
## Effects of slave trad on Oceanic trade
- Saves in silver mines in SA
- Silver from SA to India, China, Europe
- SIlver echanged for textile
- Textile to Africa for new slaves
-> triangular trade scheme

## Disruption in the Americas
- European inasion promoted regional variations of diseas and depopulation
- Forced labor and enslavement added to demographic devastation
- Increased warfare, impactng Ameridian politics and culture during wars of conquest
- Affected climate, deepening th echill of the Little Ice Age

## The Little Ice Age
- Because of demographic devastation, farmland turned into forest
- Largest forest regions absorbed carbon dioxide from the atmoshpere
- Greenhouse effect diminnished
- Large colcanic eruptions further reduced effect of run on Earth
- Between 1590 and 1710 average temperatures decreased
- affected negatively crop growth

## What happened to the populations?
### The Taino
- population of >1mil
- pandemics/population decease resulted in an easy overthrow of local rulers

## Forced Labour in the Americas
- In South America, Spanich rule continued the Inka *mita* (a forced labour raft for the silver mines):
  - Europeans used existing slavery institutions
- European authorities technically prohibited the legal enslavement of Ameridiands
- However, economies like the silver mines of Mexico, pearl fisheries off the coast of Venezuela, and early plantations in the southeast of NA used coerced native labour.

## New Empires
- Largest-scale conquests took place in Mexico and peru
- SPanish colonial systems in some ways continued native imperial traditions (like the *mita*)
- Relied on governance with indigenous elites and existing patronage networks
- Spanish colonization encountered more enduring resistance where Amerindian polities were sall, or absent (such as the Maya of Mexico's Yucat√†n peninsula)
- Resulted in conflict between European ntions (such as Dutch Portuguese control over Brazil)

## Resisting Empire
- Pueblo Revolt (1680); natives of modern-day New Mexico rose up against Spanish authority and killed or expelled SPaniards for the next 12 years
- Tupac Amaru II (last Inca ruler) revolt at the end of the 18th century (1781-1783)

## Transoceanic Econoies
- Fisheries and furs
- THe plantation zone
- 

### Fisheries and Furs
- Free, wage-earning British, French, and Basque fishermen caught cod in fisheries from Cape COd to Newfoundland, from 1520s
- Ameridins, historically hunters for fur-bearing animals, entered beaver fur export trade ~1630 (major markets: Montreal, New Amsterdam, French, British)

### The Plantation Zone
- Region spanning from the Chesapeake south to Brazil
- Became the largest destination for the majority of enslaved Africans forced onto the Middle Passage
- FOcused n profitable, labor-intensive crops including: tobacco (Chasepeake), rice (Sourh Carolina and Georgia), and sugar (Brazil)
  - Sugar plantation laborers suffered the highers mortality rates and worst livign conditions

### Silver
- Spanish authorities established large-scale silver mines Zacatecas, Mexico, and at Potosi in the Andes
- Potosi alone yielded 40k tons of silver beetween ghe 1540s and the 1780s
- Wage workers, *mita* forced to work there in absence of any other option
- The silver influx had economic effects:
  - import in Spain caused inflation and mismanagement issues

## Agricolture
- THe Spanish *encomienda* system granted settlers who created big agricultural estates the right to conscript Ameridians as unpaid laborers
- Food systems represented resistance, negotiation, and hybridization for native economies
  - The Navajo economy combined sheep herding with farming and raiding
  - Other Ameridians both resisted and added Old World crops to their gardens (no pork mean, yes peaches)
  - Native people continued to grow locally source food to avoid capture to plantations, mines, or missions
- By 1750, local cuisines combined crops and animals from the Columbian Exchange

## Shifting social HIerarchies
- Status depended on many variables:
  - ancestry, gender, age, legal status (free/enslaved), wealth, religion, affiliation
- Allowed many amerindian groups to retain old social hierarchies

| population                                       | rank |
| ---                                              | ---  |
| Prosperous whites                                | 1    |
| poor whites                                      | 2    |
| free people of mixed (african-European) ancestry | 3    |
| free blacks of Caribbean bith                    | 4    |
| free blacks of African birth                     | 5    |
| Enslaved people (90% of pop)                     | 6    |

# Independent Groups
- Maroons, communities of runaway slaves secured freedom
- Mapuche

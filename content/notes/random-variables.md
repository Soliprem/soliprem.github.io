# Random Variables

A random variable is a function that maps each outcome in a sample space, Omega, to a numerical value. In other words, it is a variable whose value depends on the outcome of a random experiment.

For example, let's say we have a coin that we flip. The sample space of this experiment is {heads, tails}. We can define a random variable, X, as follows: 

- X(heads) = 1 
- X(tails) = 0

This means that if we flip a heads, the value of X is 1, and if we flip a tails, the value of X is 0.

Another example is rolling a six-sided die. The sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. We can define a random variable, Y, as follows:

- Y(1) = 2 
- Y(2) = 4 
- Y(3) = 6 
- Y(4) = 8 
- Y(5) = 10 
- Y(6) = 12

This means that if we roll a 1, the value of Y is 2, if we roll a 2, the value of Y is 4, and so on.

In summary, a random variable is a way to associate numerical values with outcomes in a sample space. It is a fundamental concept in probability theory and is used in many applications, such as statistical inference, stochastic processes, and machine learning.

## Discrete vs Continuous random variables

In probability theory, random variables are used to represent the outcomes of random events in mathematical terms. Random variables can be classified into two main categories: discrete and continuous.

A discrete random variable is one that can only take on a countable number of possible values. For example, the number of heads in three coin flips is a discrete random variable that can only take on the values 0, 1, 2, or 3.

On the other hand, a continuous random variable can take on an infinite number of possible values within a certain range. For example, the weight of a randomly selected apple from a basket is a continuous random variable that can take on any value between 0 and the weight of the heaviest apple in the basket.

One key difference between the two types of random variables is that a probability distribution for a discrete random variable can be represented using a probability mass function (PMF), while a probability distribution for a continuous random variable can be represented using a probability density function (PDF). The PMF gives the probability that the random variable takes on a particular value, while the PDF gives the probability density at each point in the range of the random variable.

Another important difference is that the probabilities associated with a discrete random variable are discrete probabilities, meaning that they are represented by individual points on a probability distribution. In contrast, the probabilities associated with a continuous random variable are continuous probabilities, meaning that they are represented by the area under a curve on a probability distribution.

In summary, the key differences between discrete and continuous random variables lie in the possible values they can take, the type of probability distribution used to represent them, and the nature of the probabilities associated with them.

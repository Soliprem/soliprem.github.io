# Dissonance
It was a not-so-stormy night, in the most ordinary of cities in the far west of Saint Bartholomew Road. The morning was by then half spent.  
There's no point in all of this, they thought in a mumbling voice. 
It was shining bright on the dying star of Betelgeuse, and the calm atmosphere of the evening made them drousy.  
*drousy*  
Look at me, they thought. Unison.  
Fire and quelling.  
Will to power.  
Scarcity was high, gains were hot. Yet hollow-sounding-of-broken-promises.  
Dancing music was playing all-around. Circenses!  
Panem pro omnibus!  
Cos'è la vita se non delizia? Je ne peux pas l'imaginer autrement  
Gotta run, now, he thought again. His voice a tad louder.  
Her sounds shrouded by the crowd and stomped on by the ground, their feet aching from movement, and their wallet light from squandering, the legs took charge.  
Du bist die ruh, cantò avviandosi. There's very little that I ever left to chaos.

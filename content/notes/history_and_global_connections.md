# History and Global Connections: a Long-Term History (Michele Alacevich)

Connection of things rather than what traditional History course (e.g. High School)

The course emphasises global connections, not traditionsl "political" history

McNeil is one of the best authors we could hope for: he is attentive to social issues, historical events on the lives of individuals, gender issues, ability to break a European-centered focus to address several regions in the world. Doesn't mean Europe and the west are irrelevant.

Other running themes are "inequality", "enviromental issues"

# We read history through our time's lense

e.g.: Queen's death brings back discussion on UK's imperial past

History is also the study of places tht are very different from where we are now. To get it all, we need to abandon our time, and immerse in a different framework

# Introduction
Globalization is a period of growing connections between diff regions, and the West (EU+NA+Oceania+JPN) has increased in power at the expense of other regions. 

Often this story is told as a "big picture" history, of the rise of liberal, free, democratic institutions (FUKUYAMA) (aka, the end of History, reached with liberal democracy, the "perfect system").  
In other words, "First the West, then the rest"  
The growth of the World's GDP is called "the great enrichment" of the West. It is an exponential growh. This brings a growing divergence between the West and the rest.  
This inequality, visible on the global scale, is also visible within countries: the top 50% have 9% of total growth (adjusting for inflation) between 1980-2016, the top 1% got 28%. The distribution is also exponential

Inequality graphs are made by putting % on the X axys, and wealth on the y axys,

## The Long-Term Historical Trajectory of Globalization
Looking in the long-term, the divergeance is not as central: in a share of GDP from 1-2009 shows India, China, Japan, Asia vastly outperforming Europe and the West (80%-20% share). 
For most of our History, Asia was dominant, this is just a parenthesis caused by the exponential growth from the industrial revolution and the damage that colonialism caused the the Asian economies (30%-70% share).  
Right now, Asia is rising back up: the industrial revolution there was delayed, and now they're riping the benefits of exponential gowth. This is called the "G>reat Convergence"
Many Asian countries trade more with China than the USA.


### Oil crisis
1970-1979: oil producing countries increased unilaterally the price of il. Big blow to industrial countries and growing countries with no oil production (costs skyrocket for production: leads to Mexico bankrupcy of the 80s and subsequent crash of the market). There were weekends where cars were forbidden to save on gas (possible measure for pollution) (car numbers usage)

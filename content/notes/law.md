## Private Law vs Public law
**Public Law** is about the function of the sovereign body: it's about the state, authority and vertical relationships between public and the single. It's a vertical relationship

**Private law** is the relationship between "natural persons": nobody is on top. Horizontal relationship

In **Private Law** everyone's meant to be at the same level, but it's not always true

(example with a contract: if I were to make a contract with a bank, in theory we are two private, natural persons, but there's a clear power imbalance: not all persons, in reality, are actually on the same level
What is a [contract](/notes/contract)?)  
Therefore, we have specific laws to protect the weak


in **Public Law**, we're not on the same level: it's a basic rule of it

Past decisions are rarely challenged

Criminal Law is in Public Law

In practice, the state **may**, but is not forced to, use its power. Thus choosing whether to go through public or private law. Act with authority or as a private person

The state might act as a private to avoid legal repercussions, as well as to keep social credit

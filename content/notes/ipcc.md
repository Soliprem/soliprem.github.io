# IPCC

## Methodology
Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change  

6 cycles of assestement (AR) -> 3 Work groups (WG I-III)  
\+ Special report -> one assestement group  

AR6, WG3:  
- 278 authors, 128k papers, 592k review comments (aka pretty fucking reliable and transparent)
- 5 chapters, one for each "mean of implementation"
  - Step 1 what evidence is there? How much? Are the conclusions consistent?
  - If evidence good, step 4: how confindent are we? Grade it!
  - If confidence is sufficient and we have more knowledge:
    - likelyhood evaluation (%)
  - or just turn it in


SPM (summary for policymakers) is negotiated:  
- 150 pages from 4k+
- you negotiate on words because gov'ts approve it: 
  - whatever is writtena nd approved becomes accepted language.
  - example: "decent standard of living" from AR6
  - : "abated" vs "low" emissions


## Climate Change

### What's the problem?

#### CO2-eq
CO2=1  
CH4=28  
N2O=265  
HFC=124<GWP<~12k  

#### Temperature rise
actually pretty fast (IPCC 1.5):  
- 1850-1960: +0.25°
- 1960-2017: +0.75°
- ~2040: +1.50°

#### Why?
\+ CO2 concentrations (ppm CO2-eq | = CO2 equivalen | = CO2 equivalentt)  
growth is abnormal compared to trends going back ~1mil years: now at 420ppm  

concentration rise because of anthropogenic emissions (tCO2-eq)

#### natural sinks/ anthropo intakes (GtCO2/yr)
Fossil Fuoels: +34.7  
Land use change: +5.5  
Forests: -11.5  
Oceans: -9.2  

USA per capita about x2 eeryone else, lol. USA bad KEKW

but consider emissions coming fom importation/consumption: china produces  lot, but it's for western consumption


### Solve the problem? 

Need to mitigate impact on other sectors (e.g. economics)

#### Other revolutions
- e.g. The digital revolution: create new issues on employment market
  - how does it affect GHG?
- MaaS (Mobility as a Service): transportation is replaced by mobility (use of digital plts for management of movements)
- AI in buildings: concerns with privacy
- crypto
- how do we capitalise on the digital rev?

#### A just transition
- leave nobody behind: some regions are at risk
- we *need* grassroot support
- 17 sustainable development goals

## Mitigation

AR6 tells us we made very little progress: not on track for 1.5
- only 18 countries (rich af) managed to keep growth and eco friendly
- objective: net 0
- for 1.5 we need to hit net 0 by 2050
- for 2, 2070
- silver lining:
  - mitigation costs are outweighed by cost of potential damages
- we have 6 mitigation pathways (IMP) (gradual from doing nothing to staying at 1.5):
  - sus includes:
    - low demand
    - sustainables
    - ...
- Finance and insurance companies are the spear headers in the market of climate change:
  - their business models *need* a level certainty
- Energy crisi changes the scene:
  - the urgency changes the level of cohordination
- In Italy Nuclear isn't really an option because we both lack expertise and popular approval


- 3 levels of action:
  - incentives
  - regulation
  - education

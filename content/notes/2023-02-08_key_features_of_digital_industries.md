# Key features of digital industries

## Demand-side:
[network_effects](/notes/2023-02-08_network_effects)
  - multi-sided-platforms -> cross network effects:
    - monetization coming form different sides of the market
  - Market structure is often concentrared (market tipping) and barriers to entry rather high (this is a feature of network effects)
  - strong gatekeepers can leverage control of attention of population to act as intermediaries in markets

Switching costs and lock-in effects
  - behavioural biases

## Supply-side
  - Economy of scale:
  	- Concentrated markets
  	- Low prices
  - Economies of scope:
  	- diversify offer (vertical integration)
  	- data
  - Data as a key input:
  	- track consumers (ads)
  	- tool for product dev
  	- distribution of content
  	- algorithmic pricing
  	- recommended systems (e.g. Netflix, Spotify, Amazon)



Economies of scope + network effects = ecosystems

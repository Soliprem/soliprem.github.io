# Supreme Court
The Supreme Court is supposed to give us the *real, authentic* interpretation of the court

Divided in 5-6 sections, and there's one section that's the most important: the **unified section**:  
there's 100 total judges, diided in groups of 10-20. When a case arrives to the SC, it arrives to one of these sections.

The Unified Section is called for any "harder"/"more important" case: it has a duty to find the most correct interpretation of the case. When a case is decided upon by the unified section, it's almost as powerful as *stare decisis*  
(example  
different sections might disagree, but the joint section will always reach a final verdict, once called)

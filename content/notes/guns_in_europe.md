# Guns in Europe
- after 1330 guns were commonly used in EU warfare
- Bronze or iron
- Bronze: easer to cast; tech well-developed because of demand for church bells; expensive
- Iron: much more dificult to cast; prone to fractures; less developed castign tech; much cheaper
## (1350s-1450s)
- Secular phase of rapid demand increase
- Tech advancements focused on increasing the size of guns
- No standardization
- Guns effective only in siege weapons

## (1650s)
- much better gun situation
- Developments in casting tech:
  - guns became more wide-spread

## Turkish superiority in the Open Field
- Turks had superiority in the open field:
  - larger size of forces
  - better disciplice
  - superior tactics
  - high mobility of their light cavalry (cavalry very efficient)
- The only efficient obstacle Euros posed were defensive bastions vs which TUrks used Western-style artillery, BUT:
  1. They remained technologically behind, and always relied on western technicians for manufacturing cannon
  2. Their military tradition, based on horsemanship, made them blind to the uses of light artillery in the open field
  3. They were obsessed with huge guns (slow to recharge, eary to break, much ado about nothing)

## How the Chinese also Lost
- Chinese guns were as good as Western artillery until the early 15th century
- Euros offered their services to the Chinese (Jesuits established cannon foundaries in exchange for permission to open missions), yet Chinese tech lagged behind while European tech improved quickly
- On the sea, the Chinese war-junk remained essentially a vessel suited for traditional, human-based, ramming and boarding
- China's military tradition became: "keep them out", "don't engage in battle in the open field":
  - this comes probably from their encounters with the Mongols, who whooped their ass in the open field

# Suicide Note of a Lost Erran Man  
  
Lost in his errand was  
the man tucked because   
o' winterfall 'n his jacket   
wooly soft  
monotony of a rachet.  
Papers holds him dear for oft  
food on his table have they brought,  
withers his heart in shameful  
sunshine visions of pleading thought,  
his loves scream with power forceful.  
Cuddled's he by the grim hug,  
caressed by the softest touch,  
wretched in fear and agony brightful  
smile sees as he'd never witnessed such.  
Delightful raised his head on the premise,  
lightful pride praised by, sat he upon the crevice.  
Forgotten his wrongs forever shall be.  
Of him shall the burdened ever be free.

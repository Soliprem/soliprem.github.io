# Network effects
userbase = success -> really hard to challenge successful companies, who already hold a big community and userbase

Especially strong in Social Media, (DIRECT network effects), but can manifest in different ways. 

Example: google (indirect network effect): data collection from wide usage makes the product better

it's a demand-side feature (it's inherent in the type of services that are provided)

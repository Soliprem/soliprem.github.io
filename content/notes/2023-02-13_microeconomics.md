# Microeconomics
## Double hermeneutics
in all sciences, theories do not impact the behavious they decscribe. In Economics it does: economist make models about people, who use these models to make money.  
Double hermeneutics means that, right or wrong, ideas matter

## Ways to organize economic activities

| no markets                                                                 | wide role of markets        |
| no central governent or powerful boss                                      | powerful role of government |
| egalitarian                                                                | inequality                  |
| small-scale activities                                                     | large-scale organizations   |

### ways to distribute

Social tradition: distribution not by success/social power (try to keep society egalitarian)

Command: Since the agricultural revolution we see the emergence of the large agricultural empires. Hierarchies form. Modern planned economies also stem from hierarchies (e.g. Cuba, Russia, etc)

Third way of organising econ activity: markets (predominant in the west). Separates economics from politics, as markets are somewhat autonomous, but markets rely on greed (considered bad by most spiritual tradition, but legitimate motivation for action). Markets are de centralised, they go bottom-up. This creates a social order as an effect

Does tradition still play a role in modern markets? (yes):
  - the boundaries of markets have changed across history:
    - the types of goods and services that can be best served by markets is a decision that is to be made by society
		- e.g.: money-lending at interest, which was a taboo for a long time
		- slavery was a well working market, interrupted because morally repugnant
	- There's still fields where markets work well, but they're perceived as repugnant:
		- student dmission to top university
		- citizenship
		- vaccines
		- right to pollute to air or water
		- human organs
		- sexual services


Does command still play a role in modern markets? (yes):
  - ~50% of GDP in modern economies is from the state


There's a tension between markets and social norms

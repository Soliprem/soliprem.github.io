## Account Receivable and Payable
 
Initial recognition refers to the process of recognizing an account receivable or payable in the financial statements of a company for the first time. This typically occurs when a business enters into a transaction with a customer or supplier, and an invoice is generated.

Subsequent measurement refers to the process of determining the value of an account receivable or payable after initial recognition. For accounts receivable, this may involve tracking payments received from the customer, adjusting for any bad debts, and calculating the amount that is still owed. For accounts payable, this may involve tracking payments made to the supplier, adjusting for any discounts or late fees, and calculating the amount that is still owed.

Derecognition refers to the process of removing an account receivable or payable from the financial statements of a company. This typically occurs when the receivable or payable is fully paid, or when it is determined that the amount is uncollectible or no longer owed. In the case of accounts receivable, this may involve writing off the bad debt expense, while in the case of accounts payable, it may involve adjusting for any overpayments or underpayments.

## Investments
- Assets held for continuity or permanence, not to be sold or transformed in the normal course of business both if owned or leased

### gpt-definition
In the context of accounting, investment refers to the acquisition of assets with the intent of generating income or increasing the value of the assets over time. Investments can take many forms, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, mutual funds, and commodities.

From an accounting perspective, investments are classified into two categories: current and non-current. Current investments are those that are expected to be sold or converted into cash within one year, while non-current investments are expected to be held for a longer period.

Investments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value, which is the amount that would be received if the asset were sold in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Any changes in the fair value of investments are recorded as unrealized gains or losses in the comprehensive income statement, which is a component of the financial statements. Additionally, any income generated from investments is recognized as revenue on the income statement.

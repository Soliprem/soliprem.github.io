# The (soon-to-break) Old World Web
- By 1400, 3/4 of the population lived in the Old World web.
- Trade was conducted over two amain routes:
  - the Silk Road (through Central Asia by caravan)
  - By sea (with a short overland portion in Egypt)


## An Example o fthe Old orld Web: Year 1000
7 regions have 90% of pop:
- Western Europe:
  - A peripheral area compared to the centers of economic activity in the Islamic world
  - Export of slaves and raw materials
- Eastern Europe
- North Africa and WEstern Asia (In current parlance, MENA)
- Central Asia
- South Asia (India)
- Southeast Asia (China)

## Pax Mongolica (1250-1350)
Sung China and Islamic world trade with (and tribute to) border nomadic or semi-nomadic population  
1206, Gengish Khan and his successors expand both easward and westward from the steppe of central Asia.  
Kiev falls in 1240, Hungary in 1241, Iran in 1250s, Sung China in 1270s (new Yuan dynasty)  

Pax Mongolica is the period of max expansion of the OWW: it unified the supercontinent in a compex net of regional and interreg trade routes.

The integration and trade relations of the Pax Mongolica also lead to the Black death

### A thickening web
- Mastery over marine trade consolidated the webs
- improved ship designs and growing navigational knowledge
- canals and dams aided with river travel
- exchange and conquest decreased the diversity of language and religion

## Webs in the Americas
- Not as wide spread as in Europe
- in 1400 40-70 mil people; hald in the Andes or MesoAmerica
- No pack animals:
  - goods carried by watercraft/rafts
  - long-distance market less bulky/intense
- Markets were less intense and localised

## Webs of Africa
- Most of the northern half of Africa by 1400 was firmly part of the Old Wlrd web
- Western and eastern Africa has also been consolidateed into the Old World Web
- Th souterh third of Africa (like the Americas and Siberia) stood apart. They lived in their own smaller webs

# Discovery of the Open Sea: Unkown Patterns
WIth European scientific advancements, new trade routes were open in the open sea (e.g. America-Asia)

# What is Beeper
[Beeper](https://www.beeper.com) is a messaging app that seeks to end the issue of fragmentation, by allowing users to use any of 14 currently supported protocols for their chats. These protocols include things like Whatsapp, Telegram, Discord, Slack and many more.  
Recently my turn has arrived to access to Beeper's open beta. I've had a chance to try it out for the past couple of days and I must say, I'm impressed.

All Beeper had to do to catch my eye was to promise a convenient way to unify all the different networks that currently dominate the market: this kind of exploitation of platform's network effects is harmful not only to the end consumer, who might not be able to link to all their acquaintances without using 10 different apps. Thankfully I'm happy to report that it does much, much more.

# Beeper as a Daily Driver
Beeper has some strong competition in the way of chat app clients: from telegram to element to discord, there's many affirmed workflows that open it up from nitpicking from each of the communities it's trying to appeal to. 

As an example, a telegram user using the mobile app might miss some of the gesture navigation controls to open the side menu, and find the single swipe to archive clumsy. On the other hand, a google messages user will feel right at home with with this default.  
In other words, Beeper is definitely facing  a major UX challenge, but from what I've had the chance to experience so far, I'd say they're rising to it.
